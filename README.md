CSE 341 – Project 2: Movie and Reviews Library API
📌 Overview

This project is part of the CSE 341 – Web Services course.

For Week 03 (Project 2 – Part 1), the focus was on building a RESTful API that performs CRUD operations using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

For Week 04 (Project 2 – Part 2), the project was extended to include authentication using GitHub OAuth with Passport.js, allowing users to log in and access protected routes.

This repository covers both parts of the project and focuses on:

Creating a new API project

Implementing full CRUD functionality

Adding data validation and error handling

Implementing GitHub OAuth authentication

Documenting the API using Swagger

🎯 Project Purpose
